<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Hunter</h1>
<h3 align="center">I am a Software Developer based in Salt Lake City, Utah. I am an activist first. I fell in love with development when I learned it was a skill by which I can make life easier for people. The world is difficult and I want to give back wherever I can.</h3>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning **MERN Full Stack Web Development** because I like the portability and functionality of Web-based applications. 

- I have adopted a system of note-taking that uses wiki-link interlinking and promotes spaced-repetition.

- I am working through The Odin Project because for some reason I hadn't.

- I am starting from scratch relearning all my maths curiculum from Algebra to Discrete Math & Calculus

- 🤝 I’m looking for help with a Tor-enabled webview client: [TORified Freedom Wrapper](https://github.com/hdbham/TORified-Freedom-Wrapper)

- 👨‍💻 All of my projects are available at [hdbham.com](hdbham.com)

- 📄 Know about my experiences [Resume Link](Resume Link)

- ⚡**The secret to life is:** Doing now what retirees do once retired. So, try the 'boring' hobbies!. Birdwatching, metal-detecting, gold-panning and gardening might give you more genuine fulfillment than you think. Practice getting dopamine out of simple things.
